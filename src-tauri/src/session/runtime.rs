#![allow(dead_code)] // Wired into SessionManager in Step 5+; foundation now.

// Internal runtime abstraction for the session layer (impl plan
// docs/impls/0004-tmux-session-runtime.md, Step 1). The trait is the
// seam between the command layer and whoever owns the terminal —
// `TmuxRuntime` for v1 (Step 5+); a future `NativePtyRuntime` slots
// in here for Windows or for the no-dependency mode without
// rewriting commands/frontend.
//
// Intentionally small. Add methods only when a caller needs them;
// don't pre-shape an API that's purely speculative.
